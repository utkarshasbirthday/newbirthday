          <h2>Utkarsha's Birthday!</h2>
          <p>My utkarsha,
The girl is as unique as the name itself.  She loves belly bollywood, quotes films, loves to go out during rains, loves to write poetries, loves dancing.. exactly like a typical 90's bollywood heroine somehow landed in 2021.
We started talking in October 2020, in a strange and compelling way, talking to you just felt right and satisfying. I am a man of logic and reasoning, but for that feeling I still don't have any. Talking to you just felt righteous. I guess subconsciously I knew that you were by better half, the one for me.
We have celebrated your parents anniversary, new years, my birthday, but unfortunately missed out on your 28th birthday.
But no matter I did promise you that I will Make this birthday of your memorable,  nothing and no one can change that.
So here I am, wishing you a very happy birthday with all our friends and we'll wishers
A very happy birthday my dear uttu ❤️</p>

UT, you are crazy, super supportive, child-like, mature beyond your age, moody, understanding, sensitive and ANNOYING (yes, in caps) all at the same time !!
We have spent all our lives together and have created so many wonderful memories and I'm proud of the bond we share.
On your birthday, I wish you all the happiness in the world, a wish that you keep doing what makes you the happiest, and to continue keeping the child in you alive (yeah, you could try being a lil less annoying though)</p>

We've met just once but I still feel like I've known you for years. Why? For starters, Eshan never stops talking about you. I've seen how you've changed my best friend, my bro, and that is enough for me to know that you're awesome! You're the best thing to have happened to him. After me, that is. Just kidding! Eshan is family to me and now, so are you. Happy Birthday!!</p>
